# Activiity Recognition Using Smartwatch Data

This is part of my diploma thesis, which I did as part of my studies as an 
Electrical and Computer Engineer at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.  

In this thesis, I explore the use of neural networks, as well as other classifiers, in human activity
recognition using data from smartwatches, in order to contribute to the improvement of the overall care for pancreatic 
cancer patients, for the "RELEVIUM" project of the Information Technologies Institute.
