# PAMAP2 Dataset

The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/231/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring).

After you download the dataset, make sure you place it inside this folder and extract the folder. The form of the data is not
convenient, so we have to preprocess them.

To do that, run the file **preprocess_dataset.py** file found in this folder. The data are now stored in the **data.csv**
file and are ready to be used in the project.
